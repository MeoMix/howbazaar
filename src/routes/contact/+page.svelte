<div class="bold text-4xl mb-8 mt-8">Hi!</div>

<div class="text-lg mb-8">
    <div class="my-2">
        Thanks for visiting my humble little website :) I hope you're finding it
        useful so far.
    </div>
    <div class="my-2">
        I'm very interested in making this the best spot to get all your The
        Bazaar information.
    </div>
    <div class="my-2">
        I would really appreciate it if you'd contact me with any ideas, feature
        requests, or bug reports!
    </div>
    <div class="my-2">
        I can be reached on Discord, <span class="font-bold">@MeoMix</span> on The Bazaar's server or User ID:

        I'm terminally online, so you should have no trouble reaching me, but I
        do sleep from 10pm to 6am PST. Feel free to leave me a message if I'm
        not responding.
    </div>
    <div class="my-2">
        Oh, and P.S. I have spent <span class="font-bold text-red-500">~200+ hours</span> building this site, working 10
        hours/day since launch. <span class="font-bold text-green-500">Please be kind</span> when expressing constructive
        criticism about the website. Thank you.

        Upcoming Features as of November 19th, 2024:
    </div>

    <div class="mb-8">
        <span class="font-semibold">Soon (tomorrow?)</span>

        <ul class="ml-8">
            <li>
                Optimize website bandwidth to survive increasing user load
                without incurring large server costs. Thank you so much for all
                the interest and support!
            </li>
            <li>
                Polish some lingering issues with the design around legibility,
                colors, lightmode.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add support for images to Items and Skills pages! This has been
                a long-standing request.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assuming a Wednesday patch comes out, update website to reflect
                new patch changes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-8">
        <span class="font-semibold">A little later (this week/weekend?)</span>

        <ul class="ml-8">
            <li>
                Rewrite some server code related to parsing enchantment data. A
                couple of enchantments are hardcoded currently due to
                limitations in my scripts. I do not want to be in a position
                where I have to manually manage new card/enchantment additions
                to the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the ability to use Item/Skill search to find Items/Skills
                which are dropped by specific Monster Encounters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add monsters to the Monsters page which are only able to be
                encountered via events rather than Hour 3 encounters.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-8">
        <span class="font-semibold"> After that... (early next week)</span>

        <ul class="ml-8">
            <li>
                Begin creating a new page to display Vendor information. Allow
                users to see what items/skills they could get from a vendor with
                bronze/silver/gold/diamond tier probabilities influenced by
                filtering on current day.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-8">
        <span class="font-semibold">Much later</span>
        <ul class="ml-8">
            <li>
                Allow users to prototype builds online. Users will be able to
                share a link to their build to discuss it with others. This will
                be rudimentary. It won't show DPS or anything like that. It'll
                just be a way to select up to 10 items, some enchantments, some
                skills, and then share those selections with others.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an in-game extension to allow users to gain insights from
                the data exposed by the website. Allow users to submit their
                in-game data to the website to allow the website to show popular
                items/builds.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
