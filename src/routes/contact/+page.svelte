                    encountered via events rather than Hour 3 encounters.

                    Broadly improve the UX of the Monsters Page. Add a search
                    bar, try to scale images down a bit, make it easier to tell
                    items/skills at a glance.

                be rudimentary. It won't show DPS or anything like that. It'll
                just be a way to select up to 10 items, some enchantments, some
                skills, and then share those selections with others.
