        Thanks for visiting my humble little website :) I hope you're finding it
        useful so far.

    <div class="my-2">
        I'm very interested in making this the best spot to get all your The
        Bazaar information.
    </div>
    <div class="my-2">
        I would really appreciate it if you'd contact me with any ideas, feature
        requests, or bug reports!

    <div>
        Tomorrow:
        <ul class="ml-8">
            <li>Add support for enchantment effects on monster items.</li>
            <li>

            <li>
                <span class="line-through">
                    Try to figure out a good UI for supporting exclusive
                    filters. For example, "Show me all skills that only Vanessa
                    can get"
                </span>
                Done! (Poorly but good enough for a few weeks)
            </li>
            <li>
                Try to add support for filtering items by those which can be

            </li>
            <li>
                Refactor some server-side code to make long-term support of item
                enchantments easier.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="line-through">
                    Make website lag less by implementing lazy loading for
                    search results.

            <li>
                <span class="line-through">
                    Try to decide if "Hidden Tags" and "Tags" should be merged
