        You want to pay me some <span class="font-bold text-gameEffects-freeze"

        <span class="font-bold text-gameEffects-poison">cash.</span>
        to say, <span class="font-semibold italic">"Thank you!"</span> for the service,
        do you?

    <p>Well, who am I to try and stop you?</p>
    <p>Here's a link to my Ko-fi. Make it rain (or drizzle).</p>

<div class="text-lg leading-loose">
    <div class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-8">P.S.</div>

    <p>
        In the near future I'll be adding an ad to the website <span
            class="italic text-sm">(booo!)</span
        > as a means of offsetting server costs.
    </p>

    <p>
        When this occurs, I will also include a button here that you can click
        to make the ads go away <span class="italic text-sm">(yaaaay!)</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        It'll be on the honor system, so no pressure to donate to get rid of the
        ads. Just click the button and they'll go away.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you feel a teensey bit of guilt for clicking the button without
        donating, that'd be cool.
    </p>
    <p>But no pressure. Really. None at all. Not even a little bit.</p>

    <p class="text-sm mt-12">
        ...just a lonely little donate button sitting there, wishing it were
        clicked by an honest, hard-working individual.
